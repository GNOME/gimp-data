A major part of the Symbolic variant icons are a derived work from the
art-libre-symbolic theme made by the GNOME design team, taken in its 2015 form
and modified since (including new icons, modified ones, possibly removed ones):

A few more Symbolic icons are taken (e.g. gimp-lock) or derived (gimp-lock-*)
from the Adwaita icon theme as Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
United States License as well.

The Color icons are more of an original work with inspiration from other FLOSS
themes. These icons, as well as all new icons (both in Symbolic or Color
variants) are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
